# .SREL_compress-decompresser V.0.0.2

This app will allow you to make and decompress .SREL files. Available for Windows and Linux

.SREl compression is a archive file format that I made. It is specifically meant for other archive file formats. When you put turn the file(s) into a .srel,the size actually gets slightly bigger. However, when if you put it back through the original compresser (i.e. compressing a .zip into a .srel and then compressing the .srel into a .zip.), the size becomes smaller. This is not always garntieed to work, espcially for more efficent compression algorithms such as .rar compression.
